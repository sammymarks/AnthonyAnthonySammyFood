# Cocktail Connoisseur

Welcome to Cocktail Connoisseur, a dynamic mobile app created using React. In this simple user interface, you can find specific cocktails as well as discover new and random cocktails.

## Installation Guide

1. Download the project from GitHub:
   - Navigate to the project via the URL.
   - In the GitHub code tab, click on the green "Code" button located on the right of the screen.
   - Copy the HTTP or SSH or GitHub CLI URL.
   - In your local terminal, type the following commands:
     git clone {the URL you just copied}
    Example:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sammymarks/AnthonyAnthonySammyFood.git
    ```
   - Press Enter.
   - Navigate to the appropriate directory:
    ```
    cd AnthonyAnthonySammyFood/FoodE
    ```
   - Install dependencies in package.json using the following command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    Or, if you encounter errors:
    ```
    sudo npm install
    ```
    (Remember, no quotations!)

2. Run the application in your local server:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or, if you encounter errors:
    ```
    sudo npm run dev
    ```

3. Copy the local host URL and paste it in the browser address bar. Example: `http://localhost:5173/`

## Cool Features and Successes

- Full planning, including collaborative wireframes, CHD (Component Hierarchy Diagram), and Trello board.
- Wireframes were used to drive functionality discussions.
- CHD was used to visually facilitate pseudo code and design assumptions.
- Successful implementation of a search bar that displays cocktails in nicely styled cards.
- Use of Trello for collaboration and task assignment.
- useContext used extensively for state management.
- Query-free navigation with useStates/useContext instead of param-based routes.
- onClick anonymous functions to build functionality into button clicks.
- Search results mapping.
- Random cocktail generation with an onClick API call.

## Challenges

- Overcomplicating straightforward tasks.
- Attempting to insert object literals into divs by calling objects inside a for loop, which was replaced by a 15-line copy/paste solution.
- Trying to use boolean useState to determine if a cocktail was generated randomly (not needed).
- Parallel planning led to some initial discrepancies in the work.
- Successful axios call on Search page

## What We'd Do Differently Next Time

- Work through wireframes as a full group first, then divide up CHD, boilerplate, and overall CSS.
- Define more granular and specific styling and functionality requirements.
- Allocate more time for styling.
- Allocate more time for reaching stretch goals, such as building a cocktail.
